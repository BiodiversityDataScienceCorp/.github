# Biodiversity Data Science Corp.
## A Collaboration between the University of Arizona and Lewis & Clark College to promote Data Science education

In 2021, we received a 3-year grant from the National Science Foundation's [Harnessing the Data Revolution](https://www.nsf.gov/cise/harnessingdata/) grant program. The grant sub-category is Data Science Corps (DSC), which *focuses on building capacity for HDR to help unleash the power of data in the service of science and society. The DSC provides practical experiences, teaches new skills, and offers learning opportunities, in a variety of settings, to data scientists and data science students*.

Our focus is primarily on higher education, and finding commonalities and differences among approaches at a R1 institution (University of Arizona) and a small liberal arts college (Lewis & Clark College).
