# Biodiversity Data Science Corp.
__A Collaboration between the University of Arizona and Lewis & Clark College to promote Data Science education__

## Introduction

In 2021, we received a 3-year grant from the National Science Foundation's [Harnessing the Data Revolution](https://www.nsf.gov/cise/harnessingdata/) grant program. The grant sub-category is Data Science Corps (DSC), which *focuses on building capacity for HDR to help unleash the power of data in the service of science and society. The DSC provides practical experiences, teaches new skills, and offers learning opportunities, in a variety of settings, to data scientists and data science students*.

Our focus is primarily on higher education, and finding commonalities and differences among approaches at a R1 institution (University of Arizona) and a small liberal arts college (Lewis & Clark College).

## Content / Modules

The grant had three specific aims:

* Broadening early participation through the General Education curriculum.
* Broadening participation through real-world experiences.
* Broadening instructional capacity.

### Broadening early participation through the General Education curriculum

(more on Data in the Wild, and link to repo)



### Broadening participation through real-world experiences.

During the spring semester, beginning 2022, the two institutions offered a course titled **Applied Data Science Seminar**. In this course, students build data science skills and leverage them to analyze data relevant to conservation stakeholders in the US Fish and Wildlife Service, AZ Department of Transportation, and the Phoenix Desert Botanical Gardens. In collaborative teams students will work together on organizing, cleaning, analyzing and visualizing monarch and milkweed data to help improve monarch conservation approaches and efforts in the southwestern US. Students will learn more about data science and project management best practices working as a team.
